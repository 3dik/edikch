Personal Blog, maybe some notes whatever

Me:

* Computer Science student from Germany
* whatever

You can find some of my activities here:

* [Github profile](https://github.com/3dik)
* [Wordpress profile](https://profiles.wordpress.org/plocha)

This website is done using:

* [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)
* A self-made theme inspired by the [Jekyll Clean Dark Theme](https://github.com/streetturtle/jekyll-clean-dark). No Javascript, no external references, fuck yeah
* [Jekyll Asset Path Plugin](https://github.com/samrayner/jekyll-asset-path-plugin)
* Copy-pasted code of [a fork of the Jekyll Static Comments Plugin](https://github.com/mnot/jekyll-static-comments/tree/patch-1). It seems there is no proper implementation of a comment/pingback/trackback system which gets along without any Javascript or external services. Maybe I will implement something soon.
