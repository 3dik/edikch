# edikch
The source code of edik.ch

Google for "jekyll" if you don't know how this works. You can find a few informations and links about it on [about.md](about.md).

Some special notes:
* Set "url" and "baseurl" in _private-config.yml by yourself. This file is listed in .gitignore
* You probably don't need all configurations of my .htaccess file
